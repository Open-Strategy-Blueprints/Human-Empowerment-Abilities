### **Cognitive & Creative Dimension**
4. **Intuitive Leap from Ambiguity** - Creative breakthroughs from incomplete information
5. **Tragic Choice Bearing** - Making and carrying ethical burdens of incommensurable values
6. **First-Person Consciousness** - Subjective experience as the origin of all value

### **Practical & Historical Dimension**
7. **Historical Self-Reinvention** - Reinterpreting the past to shape new identities
